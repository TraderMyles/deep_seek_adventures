      "content": "{\"title\": \"PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code\", \"excerpt\": \"One of Guido’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, “Readability counts”. A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask! In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP! Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline: When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP. To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) – although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else’s mess (in true XP style). Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code. When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don’t support the feature recommended by the style guide. Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python’s implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent . When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line: # Correct: # Aligned with opening delimiter. foo = long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ) # Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. def long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ): print ( var_one ) # Hanging indents should add a level. foo = long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ) # Wrong: # Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment. foo = long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ) # Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable. def long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ): print ( var_one ) The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines. Optional: # Hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces. foo = long_function_name ( var_one , var_two , var_three , var_four ) When the conditional part of an if -statement is long enough to require that it be written across multiple lines, it’s worth noting that the combination of a two character keyword (i.e. if ), plus a single space, plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the subsequent lines of the multiline conditional. This can produce a visual conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the if -statement, which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces. This PEP takes no explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such conditional lines from the nested suite inside the if -statement. Acceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to: # No extra indentation. if ( this_is_one_thing and that_is_another_thing ): do_something () # Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors # supporting syntax highlighting. if ( this_is_one_thing and that_is_another_thing ): # Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate. do_something () # Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line. if ( this_is_one_thing and that_is_another_thing ): do_something () (Also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary operators below.) The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may either line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list, as in: my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , ] result = some_function_that_takes_arguments ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' , 'e' , 'f' , ) or it may be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multiline construct, as in: my_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , ] result = some_function_that_takes_arguments ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' , 'd' , 'e' , 'f' , ) Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs. Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation. Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters. Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side by side, and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns. The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all. Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this issue, it is okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters, provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72 characters. The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72). The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python’s implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation. Backslashes may still be appropriate at times. For example, long, multiple with -statements could not use implicit continuation before Python 3.10, so backslashes were acceptable for that case: with open ( '/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read' ) as file_1 , \\\\ open ( '/path/to/some/file/being/written' , 'w' ) as file_2 : file_2 . write ( file_1 . read ()) (See the previous discussion on multiline if-statements for further thoughts on the indentation of such multiline with -statements.) Another such case is with assert statements. Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately. For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line. Here, the eye has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are subtracted: # Wrong: # operators sit far away from their operands income = ( gross_wages + taxable_interest + ( dividends - qualified_dividends ) - ira_deduction - student_loan_interest ) To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention. Donald Knuth explains the traditional rule in his Computers and Typesetting series: “Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations” . Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code: # Correct: # easy to match operators with operands income = ( gross_wages + taxable_interest + ( dividends - qualified_dividends ) - ira_deduction - student_loan_interest ) In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth’s style is suggested. Surround top-level function and class defi\", \"domain\": \"www.python.org\", \"url\": \"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\"}"
