  "response": "- **RAG** retrieves external knowledge at inference time, keeping the base model unchanged while dynamically augmenting responses with relevant information.  \n- **Finetuning** updates the model's internal weights through training on new data, adapting its behavior permanently but without real-time external data access.  \n- **Use case**: RAG excels when information is evolving or external; finetuning is better for adapting style, tone, or specific domain tasks with stable knowledge."
