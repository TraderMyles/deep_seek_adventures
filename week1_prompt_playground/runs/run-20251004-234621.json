  "response": "Here's a clean, minimal retry strategy using Python's built-in features:\n\n## Basic Decorator Approach\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef retry(max_attempts=3, delay=1, exceptions=(Exception,)):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n                try:\n                    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n                except exceptions as e:\n                    if attempt == max_attempts - 1:\n                        raise\n                    time.sleep(delay)\n            return None\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n# Usage\n@retry(max_attempts=3, delay=2, exceptions=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError))\ndef call_api():\n    # Your API call here\n    pass\n```\n\n## Even Simpler - Function-based\n\n```python\ndef simple_retry(func, max_attempts=3, delay=1):\n    for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n        try:\n            return func()\n        except Exception:\n            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:\n                raise\n            time.sleep(delay)\n\n# Usage\nresult = simple_retry(lambda: risky_operation(), max_attempts=5)\n```\n\n## Key Design Points:\n\n1. **Configurable attempts** - Default to 3 retries\n2. **Exponential backoff** (optional enhancement) - Increase delays between retries\n3. **Exception filtering** - Only retry on specific exceptions\n4. **Clean failure** - Re-raise final exception after all attempts\n\nThis approach gives you 80% of the functionality with 20% of the code compared to full-featured libraries."
